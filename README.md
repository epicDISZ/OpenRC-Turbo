# Team Israel GitHub

This is the github used by Team Israel 2019 in the First Global challenge.
We have used OpenRC-Turbo because of early prototyping that was using phones and only expansion hubs.
All the code that is in use is contained in TeamCode/src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/teamcode/Drive.java

Thanks for the intrest!
